# Sorting-and-Searching-Algorithms #



### Sorting algorithms with strings

* Create a C++ class named MySortStrings and implement the following sorting algorithms as member functions. Each of the sorting algorithms should be able to sort strings.
  <ol>
    <li>
	1. Selection sort
    </li>
    <li>
	2. Insertion sort
    </li>
    <li>	
        3. Bubble sort
    </li>
    <li>
	4. Merge sort
    </li>
    <li>	
	5. Quicksort
    </li>
  </ol>


### Searching algorithms

* Create a C++ class named MySearch and implement the following searching algorithms as member functions.
	1. Linear search
	2. Binary search
	3. Interpolation search
	4. Jump search
