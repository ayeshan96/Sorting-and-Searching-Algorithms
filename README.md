# Sorting-and-Searching-Algorithms #



### Sorting algorithms with strings

* Create a C++ class named MySortStrings and implement the following sorting algorithms as member functions. Each of the sorting algorithms should be able to sort strings.
 <ol>
  1. Selection sort<br />
  2. Insertion sort<br />
  3. Bubble sort<br />
  4. Merge sort<br />
  5. Quicksort<br />
 </ol>


### Searching algorithms

* Create a C++ class named MySearch and implement the following searching algorithms as member functions.
	<ol>
	1. Linear search<br />
	2. Binary search<br />
	3. Interpolation search<br />
	4. Jump search<br />
</ol>
