# Sorting algorithms with strings

* Create a C++ class named MySortStrings and implement the following sorting algorithms as member functions. Each of the sorting algorithms should be able to sort strings.

	1. Selection sort
	2. Insertion sort
	3. Bubble sort
	4. Merge sort
	5. Quicksort



# Searching algorithms

* Create a C++ class named MySearch and implement the following searching algorithms as member functions.
	1. Linear search
	2. Binary search
	3. Interpolation search
	4. Jump search
