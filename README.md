# Sorting algorithms with strings

* Create a C++ class named MySortStrings and implement the following sorting algorithms as member functions. Each of the sorting algorithms should be able to sort strings.
  <ol>
    <li>
	Selection sort
</li>
<li>
	Insertion sort
</li>
<li>	
Bubble sort
</li>
<li>
	Merge sort
</li>
<li>	
Quicksort
    </li>
  </ol>


# Searching algorithms

* Create a C++ class named MySearch and implement the following searching algorithms as member functions.
	1. Linear search
	2. Binary search
	3. Interpolation search
	4. Jump search
